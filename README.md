MoonBunny it's a Rythm game about a BunnyBoy who flies inside rings on music based levels.

It's a python game, using pygame for basic game engine and Panda3D for graphics and state machine purposes. The game was a academic project released on 2007 for "Computer Graphics Project" discipline of my UFRGS graduation, made by <a href="http://www.ic.unicamp.br/~ra144644/index.html">Félix Cardoso</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kaofelix">Kao Félix</a> and myself. The project won the intern contest and granted us a brand new NVIDIA graphics card =)

Later, in 2009, I used the game as base for my graduation final paper. The paper was a comparative study of several non-usual interaction methods, as WiiMote and Bratrack, a very intersting motion capture system based on infrared cameras. The work granted me a A grade and a publication on the 2010 Symposium on Virtual and Augmented Reality.
